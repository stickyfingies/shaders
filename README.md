Getting Started

1. Run [`./build.sh`](./build.sh) to install all dependencies and build the project.
    - Run [`./build.sh -i`](./build.sh) to re-install dependencies.
    - Run [`./build.sh -w`](./build.sh) to run in **watch mode**, which continuously re-compiles your code when you make changes.

2. Run [`./build/Shaders`](./build/Shaders) to run the project.
