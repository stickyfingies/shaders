Getting Started

1. Run [`⚙️ build.sh`](./build.sh) to install all dependencies and build the project.
    - Appending `-i` or `--install` will re-install dependencies.
    - Appending `-w` or `--watch` enables watch mode for live re-compilation.

2. Run `./build/Shaders` to see something cool.
   - Press `Enter` to hot-reload the [fragment shader](./shaders/fragment.glsl).
